11. JDK 9 CompletableFuture API
In Java 9 the CompletableFuture API has been enhanced further with the following changes:

New factory methods added
Support for delays and timeouts
Improved support for subclassing.
New instance APIs have been introduced:

Executor defaultExecutor()
CompletableFuture<U> newIncompleteFuture()
CompletableFuture<T> copy()
CompletionStage<T> minimalCompletionStage()
CompletableFuture<T> completeAsync(Supplier<? extends T> supplier, Executor executor)
CompletableFuture<T> completeAsync(Supplier<? extends T> supplier)
CompletableFuture<T> orTimeout(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
CompletableFuture<T> completeOnTimeout(T value, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
We also now have a few static utility methods:

Executor delayedExecutor(long delay, TimeUnit unit, Executor executor)
Executor delayedExecutor(long delay, TimeUnit unit)
<U> CompletionStage<U> completedStage(U value)
<U> CompletionStage<U> failedStage(Throwable ex)
<U> CompletableFuture<U> failedFuture(Throwable ex)
Finally, to address timeout, Java 9 has introduced two more new functions:

orTimeout()
completeOnTimeout()
